# Beginner-Neural-Network

Trained my first Neural Network Model on the MNIST Fashion Dataset present in Keras Dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories.

Fashion MNIST is intended as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST datasetâ€”often used as the "Hello, World" of machine learning programs for computer vision. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0, 1, 2, etc.) in a format identical to that of the articles of clothing you'll use here.

Here, 60,000 images are used to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images. You can access the Fashion MNIST directly from TensorFlow.
